# Anagrame-words
Two words are anagrams if they contain all of the same letters, but in a
differentorder. For example, “evil” and “live” are anagrams because each contains
one ‘e’, one ‘i’, one ‘l’, and one ‘v’. This program reads two strings from
the user, determines whether or not they are anagrams.
